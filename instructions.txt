Attached are 2 files:

1. `users.csv`. This contains a list of users including their ID, name, and
   email address.
2. `transactions.csv`. This contains a list of transactions, including an ID, a
   user ID, and an amount. The user ID here refers to an ID of a user in the
  `users.csv` file.

Complete the following three tasks in order:

First, parse the user CSV into JSON. The expected output is a JSON array with
a JSON object for each user.

An abbreviated result looks like this:

```
[
  {
    "id": 12411824,
    "name": "Hilary Gulgowski PhD",
    "email": "ilana.mayert@kuhn-green.org"
  }
]
```

Second, include an array of transaction objects on each user object. The
transaction objects should include all transactions for the user that are
included in `transactions.csv`.

An abbreviated result looks like this:

```
[
  {
    "id": 12411824,
    "name": "Hilary Gulgowski PhD",
    "email": "ilana.mayert@kuhn-green.org",
    "transactions": [
      {
        "id": 1128,
        "amount": 646.11
      },
      {
        "id": 1950,
        "amount": 914.49
      },
      {
        "id": 2722,
        "amount": 234.55
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Finally, add a balance to the user object. This should be the sum of the amounts
for all of the user's transactions.

An abbreviated result looks like this:

```
[
  {
    "id": 12411824,
    "name": "Hilary Gulgowski PhD",
    "email": "ilana.mayert@kuhn-green.org",
    "balance": 1795.15,
    "transactions": [
      {
        "id": 1128,
        "amount": 646.11
      },
      {
        "id": 1950,
        "amount": 914.49
      },
      {
        "id": 2722,
        "amount": 234.55
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
